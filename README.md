### **Non-cherry picked** segmentation predictions on all sequences on DAVIS16:

#### **This GIF has been significantly compressed. [Check out our video at full resolution here.](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~longlian/RCF_video.html)** Inference in this demo is done *per-frame* without post-processing for temporal consistency.

### Our Method

We are still finalizing the code and will publish by the end of April.
