# Data Preparation
## Prepare data and pretrained weights
Download [DAVIS 2016](https://graphics.ethz.ch/Downloads/Data/Davis/DAVIS-data.zip) and unzip to `data/data_davis`.
Download [pre-extracted flow from RAFT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LHGYaozBGGF879lJd3JqaGQKA7oQBbfm/view?usp=sharing) (trained with chairs and things) and decompress to `data/data_davis`.
Download [DenseCL ResNet50 weights](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/hdAg5RYm8NNM2QP/download) to `data/pretrained/densecl_r50_imagenet_200ep.pth`.

## Install dependencies and `torchCRF`
The `requirements.txt` assumes CUDA 11.x. You can also install torch and torchvision from conda instead of pip.

`torchCRF` is a GPU CRF implementation typically faster than CPU implementation. If you plan to use this implementation in your work, see the `tools/torchCRF/README.md` for license.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd tools/torchCRF
python setup.py install
```

We also require `parallel` command from moreutils. If your parallel does not work (for example, the parallel from parallel package), you either need to install moreutils from system package manager (e.g. APT on Ubuntu/Debian) or from conda: `conda install -c conda-forge moreutils`.

# Train RCF
## Stage 1
To train our model on 2 GPUs, run:
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python -m torch.distributed.run --master_addr 127.0.0.1 --master_port 9000 --nproc_per_node gpu main.py configs/rcf/rcf_stage1.yaml
```
This should lead to a model with mIoU around 78% to 79% on DAVIS16 (without post-processing). Run stage 2 as well if additional gains are desired.

## Stage 2.1 (Low-level refinement)
This stage uses Conditional Random Field (CRF) to get training signals based on low-level vision (e.g., color). Prior to running this stage, we need to get the object channel through motion-appearance alignment.
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tools/SemanticConstraintsAndMAA/maa.py --pretrain_dir saved/saved_rcf_stage1 --first-frames-only --step 43200
export OBJECT_CHANNEL=$?
```

Then we could run training (which will continue training from pretrained stage 1 model):
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python -m torch.distributed.run --master_addr 127.0.0.1 --master_port 9000 --nproc_per_node gpu main.py configs/rcf/rcf_stage2.1.yaml --opts object_channel $OBJECT_CHANNEL
```

## Stage 2.2 (Semantic constaints)
This stage uses a pretrained ViT model from DINO to get training signals based on high-level vision (e.g., semantics discovered in unsupervised learning). Semantic constraints are enforced offline due to its low speed.
```shell
# export the predictions on trainval
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py configs/rcf/rcf_export_trainval_ema.yaml --test --test-override-pretrained saved/saved_rcf_stage2.1/last.ckpt --opts checkpoints_dir saved/saved_rcf_stage2.1 object_channel $OBJECT_CHANNEL
# run semantic constraints
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tools/SemanticConstraintsAndMAA/semantic_constraints.py --pretrain_dir saved/saved_rcf_stage2.1 --object-channel $OBJECT_CHANNEL
# training with semantic constraints
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python -m torch.distributed.run --master_addr 127.0.0.1 --master_port 9000 --nproc_per_node gpu main.py configs/rcf/rcf_stage2.2.yml --opts object_channel $OBJECT_CHANNEL train_dataset_kwargs.pl_root saved/saved_rcf_stage2.1/saved_eval_export_trainval_ema_torchcrf_ncut_torchcrf/$OBJECT_CHANNEL
```

This should give you a 80% to 81% mIoU.

# Evaluate
## Without CRF Post-processing
To unofficially evaluate a trained model, run:
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py configs/rcf/rcf_eval.yaml --test --test-override-pretrained saved/saved_rcf_stage2.2/last.ckpt --test-override-object-channel $OBJECT_CHANNEL
```
We encourage evaluating the model with our evaluation tool, which is supposed to closely match the DAVIS 2016 official evaluation tool.
To evaluate a trained model with the evaluation tool on the exported masks (stage 2.2 will export masks on validation set by default):
```shell
python tools/davis2016-evaluation/evaluation_method.py --task unsupervised --davis_path data/data_davis --year 2016 --step 4320 --results_path saved/saved_rcf_stage2.2/saved_eval_export
```

## With CRF Post-processing
To refine the exported masks from a trained model with CRF post-processing, run:
```shell
sh tools/pydenseCRF/crf_parallel.sh
```

Then evaluate the refined masks with evaluation tool:
```shell
python tools/davis2016-evaluation/evaluation_method.py --task unsupervised --davis_path data/data_davis --year 2016 --step 4320 --results_path saved/saved_rcf_stage2.2/saved_eval_export_crf
```

This should reproduce around 83% mIoU (J-FrameMean).

# Train AMD (our baseline method)
This repo also supports training [AMD](https://github.com/rt219/The-Emergence-of-Objectness). However, this implementation is not guaranteed to be identical to the original one. In our experience, it reproduces results that are slightly better than the original reported results without test-time adaptation (i.e., fine-tuning on the downstream data). The setup for training set (Youtube-VOS) is simply unzipping the `train_all_frames.zip` from Youtube-VOS to `data/youtube-vos/train_all_frames`. The setup for validation sets are the same as RCF.

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python -m torch.distributed.run --master_addr 127.0.0.1 --master_port 9000 --nproc_per_node gpu main.py configs/amd/amd.yaml
```
